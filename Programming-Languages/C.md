# C Programming Language
C programming language was originally developed by Dennis Ritchie in 1972. C is considered as a middle level language. The development of C in 1970s was considered no less than a revolution as writing computer programs became much simpler than writing assembly code.

C quickly became widespread and accepted in the whole community and hence an ANSI C - a standardized definition of C was established. C follows the procedural and structural programming paradigms. C has many simple data types, operators, macros, functions, etc which make it a very simple programming language. However C has pointers that allows it low level memory access which makes C a very powerful language!

The access to low level hardware, faster execution time and efficient mapping of high level code to machine instructions has made it a de facto in the assembly level programming and embedded programming.

> Many other languages are heavily inspired by C!
