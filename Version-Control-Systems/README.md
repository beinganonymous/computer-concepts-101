# Version Control Systems
Version control systems as the name suggest are tools for handling and managing different versions of a code. As the project size grows and members contributing to the same code increases it get difficult to maintain the meta data about the project and its files.
These include who made the last changes to a file, when was the last time a particular file was modified, etc.

Version Control Systems can be thought of as a code management database which includes all this meta data. Any and every change made to the project files is tracked and saved. This is called a snapshot of the project at that particular point in time. If the project code is messed up, you can revert back to a previous stable working snapshot anytime without large overheads.

Version Control Systems also provide the comparison of files (known as diffs) which help in resolving any conflicts that occur while merging code.
